---> What is Disaster Recovery? (*****)	 

Disaster recovery is required for business continuity and to avoid data loss, revenue loss.
Disaster recovery enable us to run all critical business applications, databases and services 
from DR site after a disaster.

Disaster recovery is a secondary site where all the production data from primary site is replicated.
If there is any disaster happens at primary site then DR site is invoked 
and all critical bsiness applications, databases and services are run from DR site. 
Disaster can be due to power failure, Huge fire, earthquake etc.
The primary site and the DR site should be located in two different geographical locations.
Nowadays, we can also use cloud as DR site.

===============================================================================================	
Benefit of effective disaster recovery?

Effective disaster recovery enables to recover quickly after a disaster with minimal loss of data. 
It also helps is completing backup faster.
	
	
How is disaster recovery performed?

We use below technologies for disaster recovery.
Replication and Backup/Restore.
	
===============================================================================================	
(*****)	 ---> What is RPO?  	"RPO means Recovery Point Object.

RPO is the point-in-time to which data must be recovered after an outage.
RPO defines the amount of data loss that a business can accept. 
Based on the RPO, we can plan for the frequency of backup or replication.
For example, if the RPO of a particular business application is 12 hours, 
then backups should be taken in every 12 hours."
===============================================================================================	

(*****)	 ---> What is RTO?

RTO means Recovery Time Object

RTO is the time within which data must be recovered after an outage.
RTO is the downtime that a business can accept."

===============================================================================================	
	
(*****)	 ---> What technology you use for disaster recovery?
	Backup, restore, Synchronous and Asynchronous Replication.
	
===============================================================================================	
(*****)	What is replication

Replication is a continuous process of coping production data from primary site to DR site 
to support backup and disaster recovery.
	
===============================================================================================	
(*****)	 ---> What is Synchronous replicatoin?

Synchronous replication is a mode of replication.
Synchronous replication provides zero RPO.
In Synchronous replication, server sends a write request to source storage.
Source storage writes data to the cache and sends the data to remote storage.
Remote storage writes data to the cache and sends acknowledgement to source storage.
Source storage sends ""write-complete"" acknowledgement to server.

In synchronous replication, Application response time is increased as writes are committed 
ot both the source and the remote storage before sending the “write complete” acknowledgment 
to the server.
The supported distance between source and remote storage should be between 100KM to 150KM 
and RTT should be less than 10ms."
	There are 2 modes in synchronous replication (StrictSync and Sync)
	
===============================================================================================	
(*****)	 ---> What is Asynchronous replication:

Asynchronous replication is a mode of replication.
In Asynchronous replication, RPO is configurable from 5 minutes to 24 hours.
In Asynchronous replication, server sends a write request to source storage.
Source storage writes data to the cache and immediately sends ""write-complete"" acknowledgement 
to the server.
After that as per predefined schedule, source storage sends data to Remote storage.
Remote storage writes data to the cache and sends acknowledgement to the source storage.

In Asynchronous replication, application response time is not increased as the writes are 
commited to source storage only and source storage immediately 
sends the ""write complete” acknowledgment to the server.

Supported distance between source and remote storage can be 1000s of kilometers"
	
===============================================================================================
(*****)	 ---> What is snapshot?

Snapshot is dependant point in time copy of source volume. 
During snapshot it does not copy all the data from source volume to snapshot 
but it only creates pointers to source data.      
Initially, snapshot does not reserve any space but as the data changes on source volume, 
it starts consuming storage space to store data.
So as the time progresses, snapshot size increases"
	
===============================================================================================	
(*****)	 ---> How snapshot works? Snapshot methods?

There are 2 types of snapshot technologies are in use 
"Copy On Write First"  technology or "Redirect On Write" technology.

In Copy On Write First technology, If there is any data change on the source volume 
then old data from source volume is copied to snapshot and new data is written to source volume.          
Snapshot holds old data and source volume holds latest data. 
Performance is little impacted here as data is copied from source volume to snapshot 
and then new data is wrtten to source volume."

"In Redirect On Write technology" 
If there is any data change on the source volume, then new data is redirected to snapshot
and source volume is intact. 
In ROW technology, snapshot holds new data and source volume holds old data. 
Performance is improved here as there is no process of coping old data from source volume to snapshot 
and new data is directly written to snasphsot."
	
	
(*****)	 ---> What is snapclone?
Weak	"Snapclone is independant point in time copy of source volume.
During snapclone it copies all the data from source volume to snapclone.
Once snapclone is created, after that any changes made to source volume are not reflected to snapclone.
Snapclone reserves the space equal to the size of source volume."
	
	
(*****)	 ---> What is Multipath or multipathing software?
Weak	"In SAN infrastructure, We have multiple physical path between server and storage.
In SAN infrastructure, usually we have 2 SAN Switches.

2 HBA cards in each server, One HBA connects to SAN Switch1 and other HBA connects to SAN Switch2.
2 storage controllers with atleast 2 FC ports on each storage controller, one connects to SAN Switch1 
and other connects to SAN Switch2.

So with this SAN infrastructure, we will have multiple physical paths between server and storage.
Multiple physical paths are required to avoid single point of failure.
These physical path may fail due to HBA card failure, FC cable damage, 
SFP fault, SAN Switch or Storage Controller failure etc."
Weak	"So Multipathing software can be used to manage these multiple physical paths and to load balance, 
to redulatency.

Multipathing software hides all physical path and provides a single path to the server.
If there is any active path fails then it switches to alternate path."

======================================================================================================	
(*****)	 ---> What are load balancing policies or multipathing policies in VMware?
There are multiple policies such as.

=> Round robin
=> Fixed path

Most Recently Used"
	What is the default policy in Vmware???
	"Round Robin policy uses all available paths and attempts to evenly distribute I/O across all available paths 
to reduce latency and to load balance."
	
	"Fixed policy uses preferred path if it is configured. 
Otherwise, it uses the first working path which was discovered at system boot time. 
If the preferred path fails, then it switches to an alternate path. 
Once the preferred path is restored then it automatically switches back to the preferred path. "
	
	"Most Recentrly Used policy uses the first working path which was discovered at system boot time. 
If this path fails, it switches to an alternative availablable path. 
If previously failed path is restored then it does not switch back to previous path but continue 
to use the alternate path."
	
======================================================================================================	
(*****)	 ---> Load balancing policy or multipathing policies in Windows?
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwaaBZLMqE
Weak	"Round Robin policy
Fail Over Only policy
Failback policy
Round-robin with a subset of paths policy
Dynamic Least Queue Depth policy
Weighted Path policy"
	
	"Round Robin policy uses all available paths and attempts to evenly distribute I/O across all available paths 
to reduce latency and to load balance.
This is the default policy."
	
Weak	"Fail Over Only policy uses a primary path.
If the primary path fails, then it switches to an alternate paths.
It the primary path is restored then it doesn't switch back to primary path but continue to use alternate path."
	
	"Failback policy uses a preferred path.
If the preferred path fails, then it switches to an alternate path.
If preferred path is restored then it automatically switches back to the preferred path."
	
Weak	"Round-robin with a subset of paths.
Here we define 2 sets of path, one is primary set and another is standby set. 
It uses all the paths from primary set, 
it attempts to evenly distribute I/o across all the paths in primary set to reduce latency and  to load balance, 
as long as at least one of the paths is available. 
If no path is available in primary set then it switches to an alternate path of standby set. 

If one or more path of primary set is restored, then it switches back to path of primary set.
 
For example, given 4 paths — A, B, C, and D — A, B, and C are listed as primary paths, and D is standby path. 
It chooses a path from A, B, and C in round-robin fashion as long as at least one of them is available.

If all three path fails in primary set, then It uses path in standby path. If path A, B, or C is restored, 
it switches back to available paths in primary set."
	
Weak	Dynamic Least Queue Depth policy uses the path which has least number of outstanding requests.
	
Weak	"Weighted Path policy assigns weights to each path.
It uses the path which has the least weight"

(*****)	What are types of Storage System? 	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71iiAzlF2Rs

1)	Block-based Storage (SAN)
2)	File-based Storage (NAS)
3)	Object-Based Storage (OSD)
4)	Unified Storage"

Let's explore how data deduplication works in different storage technologies, specifically focusing on Block-based Storage (SAN), File-based Storage (NAS), Object-Based Storage (OSD), and Unified Storage.

## 1. Block-based Storage (SAN)

**Storage Area Network (SAN)** uses block-based storage, where data is stored in fixed-size blocks. Deduplication in SAN typically occurs at the block level.

### How It Works:
- **Chunking**: Data is divided into fixed-size blocks.
- **Hashing**: Each block is hashed to create a unique identifier (hash value).
- **Comparison**: The hash values are compared to identify duplicates.
- **Storage**: Unique blocks are stored, while duplicates are replaced with references to the original block.

### Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Reduces storage space by eliminating redundant blocks.
- **Performance**: Enhances performance by reducing the amount of data to be read/written.
- **Cost Savings**: Lowers storage costs by optimizing space usage.

### Example:
In a SAN environment, when multiple virtual machines store similar operating system files, deduplication ensures that only one copy of each block is stored, significantly reducing storage requirements.

## 2. File-based Storage (NAS)

**Network Attached Storage (NAS)** uses file-based storage, where data is stored as files. Deduplication in NAS typically occurs at the file level.

### How It Works:
- **Chunking**: Files are divided into smaller chunks.
- **Hashing**: Each chunk is hashed to create a unique identifier.
- **Comparison**: The hash values are compared to identify duplicates.
- **Storage**: Unique chunks are stored, while duplicates are replaced with references to the original chunk.

### Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Reduces storage space by eliminating redundant file chunks.
- **Simplified Management**: Easier to manage and access files.
- **Cost Savings**: Lowers storage costs by optimizing space usage.

### Example:
In a NAS environment, when multiple users store similar documents or media files, deduplication ensures that only one copy of each chunk is stored, reducing storage space.

## 3. Object-Based Storage (OSD)

**Object Storage Devices (OSD)** store data as objects, which include the data itself, metadata, and a unique identifier. Deduplication in OSD typically occurs at the object level.

### How It Works:
- **Chunking**: Objects are divided into smaller chunks.
- **Hashing**: Each chunk is hashed to create a unique identifier.
- **Comparison**: The hash values are compared to identify duplicates.
- **Storage**: Unique chunks are stored, while duplicates are replaced with references to the original chunk.

### Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Highly scalable, suitable for large volumes of unstructured data.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces storage space by eliminating redundant object chunks.
- **Cost Savings**: Lowers storage costs by optimizing space usage.

### Example:
In an OSD environment, when storing large amounts of unstructured data such as images or videos, deduplication ensures that only one copy of each chunk is stored, optimizing storage space.

## 4. Unified Storage

**Unified Storage** combines block, file, and object storage into a single system. Deduplication in unified storage can occur at multiple levels (block, file, and object).

### How It Works:
- **Chunking**: Data is divided into chunks based on the storage type (block, file, or object).
- **Hashing**: Each chunk is hashed to create a unique identifier.
- **Comparison**: The hash values are compared to identify duplicates.
- **Storage**: Unique chunks are stored, while duplicates are replaced with references to the original chunk.

### Benefits:
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple storage types in a single system.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces storage space by eliminating redundant data across different storage types.
- **Cost Savings**: Lowers storage costs by optimizing space usage.

### Example:
In a unified storage environment, deduplication can optimize storage space by eliminating redundant data across block, file, and object storage, providing a comprehensive solution for diverse storage needs.

### Follow-Up Questions

- Are you interested in specific deduplication techniques or algorithms for any of these storage types?
- Would you like to know about any particular use cases or examples of data deduplication in practice for these storage systems?
- Do you need information on implementing data deduplication in a specific storage system or software?

(*****)	What is Block-based Storage (SAN-based)?

Block based storage is block level storage.
It is also known as fabric-based storage. It is used in SAN environement.
In Block storage, we have 2 redundant controllers with atleast FC ports.
FC ports are connected to 2 different SAN Switches using fibre optic cable.
It has multiple disk enclosures with multiple disks.
We can create pools and RAIDGroups using multiple disks and apply RAID level.
We can create multiple LUNs and allocate to different host.
Host uses HBA cards to connect to SAN Switches.
Host uses FC protocol to access Storage LUNs.

it is also known as file-based storage, file level storage.
NAS is a dedicated, high-performance file sharing storage.
NAS is connected to ethernet switches using ethernet cables.
In NAS we have multi disk with RAID configured.
In NAS, we can create CIFS and NFS shares and we can export them to Windows  and Linux clients 
over IP network.
Windows uses can use CIFS protocol to access CIFS shares.
Linux user can use NFS protocol to access NFS shares.
Windows users can map CIFS shares. Linux users can mount NFS shares. 
Windows and Linux users can use these shares without formating to store files and folders.
Same shares can be access by multiple users."

============================================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Object-Based Storage Device (OSD)?

Object based storage is a type of storage.
In Object based storage, data is stored in the form of objects on a flat address space.
There is no hierarchy followed for storing objects such as folder withing folder, object in a folder.
An object within an object is not possible. 
All objects are stored on a flat address sapce.
Every Object is identified by a unique identifier called an object ID. 
That object ID can be used to access objects without knowing the exact storage location of the object.
Example of objects such as files, documents, pictures, movies, songs etc."

1) Dual Controller (more than one controller for redundancy )
2) Disk shelf"
============================================================================================================================	
	
(*****)	What is controller? What are prts of controller?
"Controller is a major part of Storage.
Controller is a compute system that runs a purpose-built operating system.

Contorller has CPU, Memory, Cache, NVRAM, Batery Backup, Frontend ports, Backend ports, 
Daul Power Supply, disk enclosures and disks etc"
	
============================================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is the function of controller? What is the task of controller?
"Controller performs several key functions such as I/O operations, cahce management, Storage management, 
Pool and RAIDGroup management, RAID protection, 
Data compression, data deduplication, data encryption, 
Snapshot, Snapclone, Local replication, remote replication and Storage tiering."
	
============================================================================================================================	
Very Weak	"Cache
Cache is faster than the spinning disk and it improves performance.
Cache is used to read and write data.
When a host sends a write request to storage.
Storage writes the data to the cache and sends ""write-complete"" acknowledgement to the host.
Later on when the storage is less loaded or idle, it writes data to the disk.
When a host sends a read request, if requested data is available in the cache then it is sent from the cache else 
it retrieves the data from disks, write to cache and then sent to hosts.

It is also used to calculate Parity information.
If there is a disk failure then cache is also used to reconstruct data.
It is also used for data compression, deduplication, snapshot, snapclone, local and remote replication."
	
	"NVRAM
NVRAM is a Non Volatile Memory. It is used to store data from cache. 
If there is power failure then Battery Backup provides temporary power to storage, 
so that all the data from cache can be trsnferred to NVRAM.
Data is persistant in NVRAM and it is not lost even when there is no power to storage."
	
	"Front End Ports are used to connect to SAN Swithces, host connect to front end port for LUN access.

Banke End Ports are used to connect to the disk shelves via dual link control cards.

============================================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is read hit?
When a host sends a read request to storage and if requested data is available in the cache 
then it is sent from the cache to the host. This is known as a Read hit. 
	
============================================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is read miss?

	"When a host sends a read request to storage, if requested data is not available in the cache, 
then data is retrieved from the disks, wrtiten to the cache and sent to the host. 
This is known as a Read miss."
	
============================================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Write-Back Operation?

When a host sends a write request to storage.
Storage writes the data to the cache and sends ""write-complete"" acknowledgement to the host.
Later on when the storage is less loaded or idle, it writes data from cahce to the disk.
	
============================================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Write-Through Operation?
	"When a host sends a write request to storage.
Storage writes the data to the cache and immediately writes the data to disks and 
sends ""write-complete"" acknowledgement to the host.

So as the data arrives to storage, it passes through cache and written to disks.
The risk of data loss is low"

Weak	"To get 10,000 IOPS and 50TB storage capacity we have to use 3 formulas.

1st Formula is to find total RAIDGroup IOPS.
2nd formula is to find total no of disk required to get total RAIDGroup IOPS.
3rd formula is to find total usable capacity of RAIDGroup

Required IOPS is 10000, but the total RAIDGroup IOPS will be more than that due to 
% of read, % of write and RAID penalty.

Required IOPS 
= Total RAIDGroup IOPS * Write percentage/Write penalty + Total RAIDGroup IOPS * Read percentage

With this formula we get ""Total RAIDGroup IOPS"""
	"Now we can find total no of disks required to get total RAIDGroup IOPS.

Required no of disks = Total RAIDGroup IOPS/IOPS of a single disk + no of parity disk + no of spare disk

	"Required no of disks = Total RAIDGroup IOPS/IOPS of a single disk + parity disk + spare disk

Required no of disks = 16000/200 + Parity disks + Spare disks
Required no of disks = 92 + 10 + 4
Required no of disks = 106"
	
	"Total usable capacity of RAIDGroup = (Total no of disks - parity disks - spare disk) * size of disk

Total usable capacity of RAIDGroup = (106 - 10 - 4) * 550
Total usable capacity of RAIDGroup = 92 * 550
Total usable capacity of RAIDGroup = 50.6 TB"
	
	"If we take 100 SAS 600GB 15K RPM disks.
And we configure 10RaidGroups with 10 disks in each RG and Apply RAID5.

So we wil get 9 disk space in each RG.
So we will get total 90 disks space.
Total space will be 550 GB x 90 = 49500 GB = 49.5 TB"

Very Weak	"iSCSI is a SAN protocol which runs over existing ethernet network.
By using ISCSI, we can transfer block level data over existing ethernet network. 
In iSCSI, we usesIQN and IP addresses. (IQN = iSCSI Qualified Name) 
In iSCSI, SCSI data is encapsulated into IP packet and then transfered over existing ethernet network using TCP/IP protocol.
iSCSI implementation is easy and inexpensive as we do not need invest into SAN Switches, FC HBA cards, 
Fibre Optic cables etc.

In iSCSI servers, we need to add iSCSI Target IP addresess to discover and access storage LUN
To map LUNs to iSCSI servers, we have to create storage group and add server IQN and target LUNs.
Now from server side we can discover LUN in disk management."

Need to re-check on this	"Bridge iSCSI connectivity is used when we do not have ethernet ports for iSCSI in our storage system.
Bridge iSCSI is a multiprotocol router or it is also known iSCSI gateway. 
It has both Fibre Channel ports and Ethernet iSCSI ports.
On FC ports FC storage is connected and on Ethernet port either compute system are connected directly or standard ethernet switch is connected.
iSCSI gateway encapsulates FC frames into IP packets and forwards to ethernet ports.
It also decapsulates FC frame from IP Packet then forwards to the native FC interfaces. 
In iSCSI initiator, gateway’s IP address is configured as the target destination. 
On the storage system facing side, the gateway is configured as an FC initiator."

(*****)	What is Fibre Channel protocol?

Fibre Channel is a high-speed block data transport protocol over fiber optic cables.
Fibre Channel is a block level protocol, it supports block level I/O.
Fibre Channel speed can be upto 128 Gb/s. 
Fibre Channel protocol is used in SAN environment."

(*****)	What is SAN?
	"SAN is storage area network.
In SAN environment, Fibre Channel protocol is used. 
In SAN environment, Each server will have 2 HBA cards.
One HBA connects to SAN Switch1 and another connects to SAN Switch2 using Fibre Optic cables.
Storage will have 2 controllers.
Each controller will have atleast to FC front end ports.
One FC port connects to SAN Switch1 and another FC port will connect to SAN Switch2 using Fibre Optic Cables.
In SAN Switches, We can configure zoning to group host wwpn and storage wwpn,
So that host can communicate with storage using FC protocol.
In Storage, We can create Pool and RaidGroup, 
We can apply RAID levels. 
We can create and alloate LUNs to hosts.

	"DAS topology (Point to Point topology)
Host directly connects to storage using HBA and Fibre Optic cable."
	
	"FC-AL (Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop topology)
Hub is used to connect hosts and storage.
Hub is a shared bandwidth, one communication at a time.
No zoning supported in Hub so it is not secure.
Adding or removing a device from loop, breaks the loop."
	
	"FC-SW (Fibre Channel Switched topology)
Switch is used to connect hosts and storage.
There is no bandwidth sharing, dedicated bandwidth per port.
Zoning is supported in Switch, so it is secure.
Adding or removing a device from fabric, does not impact fabric."

The edge tier is composed of departmental switches which are not connected to each other.

The core tier is composed of enterprise director switches which are not connected to each other.

The edge tier switches are connected to core tier switches through ISLs (InterSwitch Linked).

Hosts are connected to Edge tier Switches. Storages are connected to Core tier Switches.

Hosts which require high performance can directly connect to Core tier Switches to avoid ISL delays.

The core-edge topology increases connectivity within the FC SAN while conserving the overall port utilization."

(*****)	What is Link Aggregation? What is port channel? LACP?

When we have multiple physical link between 2 Ethernet Switches.
We can bundle multiple physical links into a single logical link.
The advantage of link aggregation is higher bandwidth and throughput, 
to create redundancy, to load balance and to reduce latency.

============================================================================================================================	
(*****)	Types of optical cables?
	"There are two types of optical cables: Multimode and Single-mode 

Multimode fibre cable is used for short distance (Less than 400 Meters).
In Multimode fiber optic cable, multiple rays of light flows simultaneously at different angles. 
There are chances of collision of these rays of light.         
Because of this collision signal strength and distance is reduced

Single-mode fibre cable is used for long-distance (More than 400 Meters)
In Single-mode fiber optic cable, single ray of light flows.
So there is no question of collision, so distance is increased."
	
	"Multimode fiber (MMF) cable carries multiple beams of light that is projected 
at different angles simultaneously onto the core of the cable. 
In an MMF transmission, multiple light beams traveling inside the cable tend 
to disperse and collide. 
This collision weakens the signal strength after it travels a certain distance 
– a process that is known as modal dispersion.

Single-mode fiber (SMF) carries a single ray of light that is projected 
at the center of the core. 
The small core and the single light wave help to limit modal dispersion. 
Single-mode provides minimum signal attenuation over maximum distance (up to 10 km). 
A single-mode cable is used for long-distance cable runs, 
and the distance usually depends on the power of the laser at the transmitter 
and the sensitivity of the receiver."

F_port is a port where N_Port is connected."
	
E_Port :: E_Port is also known as expansion port. 
When we wnat to connect 2 different switches, then we should configure switch port as E_Port.
E_Port of SAN Switch1 connects to the E_Port of SAN Switch2.
This connection is also known as ISL.

Weak	"During Disaster Recovery planning, We list down all applications.
We group them into tiers (Tier1, Tier2, Tier3)
Tier 1 applications are those applications which should be restored as soon as possible. 
Tier 2 applications are those applications which are important but not as urgent, and can be put on hold for few hours. 
Tier 3 applicationss are less important and can wait for a few days if necessary. 
Some applications will become more or less important, thus changing tiers.
For each application, we conclude, How much data loss and downtime is acceptable.

	https://www.dell.com/community/RecoverPoint/Bandwidth-requirement-calculation/td-p/6787415
Weak	"To find out required network bandwidth to support RPO, RTO and disaster recovery, 
we need to find out how much data will change for each luns over a given period of time.
After the initial sync only the changed blocks will be replicated to DR site.
So we will find out total data change for all the LUNS during the busiest hour, which are configured 
in replication and convert that to Mb/s.

So for an example.
Lun 1, data change is 1GB for an hour
Lun 2, data changes id 2GB for an hour
total data changed = 3 GB
Convert to MB  --->  3GB * 1024 = 3072MB
Convert the MB to Mb ---> 3072*8 = 24576Mb
24576Mb is the amount of data changed in a hour on our luns, 
we need to convert this to the average per second ---> 
24576 / (60*60) = 24576 / 3600 = 6.83 Mb/s"

(*****)	What is Scale-UP and Scale-out architecture?
	"Scale-up means adding capacity to existing controllers.
Scale-out means adding performance and capacity.
Scale-up and scale-out architecture allows you to start small and grow as the business demand"
	"2 Types of implementation (Scale-up and Scale-out architecture).
	Storage system have 2 major components (Controllers and Disk shelf). 
	Controllers have front end ports, Cache, back end ports and 
	Storage have disk shelf (having multiple disks). 
	In scale-up, storage and controllers can be scaled-up interdependently or separately.
	Initially we can start with 2 controllers and 1 disk shelf, 
	later we can add more disk shelves (Scale-up). 
	Once controller's supported no of disk shelves are exhausted, 
	then we can add more controllers (scale-up) 
	and then we can add more disk shelves to new controllers. 
	Adding controller will give us more processing power, more cache, more memory 
	and more front end, back end ports and IOPS. 
	Adding disks will give more capacity, IOPS, 
	so in scale-up, controllers and storage can be scaled-up separately.

	In scale-out solution we are using node based architecture in a cluster. 
	Node, contains controller and internal storage (disks). 
	We can add new node to cluster (scale-out) and we get additional controller and stroage (disks). 
	With the new node we add controller and storage together."
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Storage Provisioning?
	Storage Provisioning is the process of assigning storage resources to compute systems.
	Two way of storage provisioning
=====================================================================================================	
	
(*****)	What is Thin-provisioning
Weak	"Thin provisioning is the storage efficiency feature.
In Thin provisioning, Over-provisioning is allowed.
We can create and allocate multiple LUNs 
Total size of all the LUN can cross total physical storage capacity.

When we create and allocate a thin LUN, initially no physical storage is allocated to LUN.
Host can see full capacity of the LUN and assumes that it has full capacity available.
As the host writes data to the LUN, physical storage is allocated to the LUN.
So the allocation is as per hots demand.
Unused capacity of the LUN will be with the storage.

In thin provisioning, we have to monitore capacity utilization as it should not reach to 100%."
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Thick-provisioning

In Thik provisioning, Over-provisioning is not allowed.
Allocating more than the physical storage capacity is not allowed.
We can create and allocate multiple LUNs 
Total size of all the LUNs can not cross total physical storage capacity.

When we create and allocate a thick LUN, full physical storage is allocated to LUN.
For Example
If we have a Pool of 500GB then total LUN size can not cross 500GB.
we can create 5 LUNs f 100GB each or 2 LUNs of 250GB each but at point of time, 
we can not cross limit of 500GB."
	
=====================================================================================================	

(*****)	What is RAID?
	"Redundant Array of Independent Disks
RAID is a technique that combines multiple disk drives into a RAID Group/RAID set. 
RAID Group is a logical group of one or more disk drives that we eventually want to slice into LUNs.
RAID provides data protection, improved performance or both.
RAID uses mirroring or parity technique for data protection against disk failure. 
And striping technique for improved performance.

There are 2 types of RAID, Hardware RAID and Software RAID.
Hardware RAID is implemented by using a specialized hardware controller.
Software RAID is built into Operating System and it is implemented at the operating-system level."
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is striping?
	Striping is a technique of spreading data across multiple drives simaltaneously.
	
	"Striping is a technique of spreading data across multiple drives simaltaneously. 
All the read/write heads of all the drives work simultaneously, 
allowing more data to be processed in a shorter time. 
This approach increases the performance, compared to reading and writing from a single disk. 
The set of aligned strips that spans across all the disks within the RAID set is called a stripe. 
The figure shows representations of a striped RAID set. 
Strip size (also called stripe depth) describes the number of blocks in a strip 
(represented as “A1, A2, A3, and A4”). 
All strips in a stripe have the same number of blocks. 
Having a smaller strip size means that the data is broken into smaller pieces 
while it is spread across the disks. 
Stripe size (represented as A) is a multiple of strip size by the number of data disks 
in the RAID set. 

For example: in a four-disk striped RAID set with a strip size of 64 KB, 
the stripe size is 256 KB (64 KB x 4).   
Striped RAID does not provide any data protection unless parity or mirroring is used."
=====================================================================================================	
	
(*****)	What is Mirroring?
	"Mirroring is a technique whereby the same data is stored on two or more disks 
resulting in multiple copies of the data. 
If one disk drive failure occurs, the data remains intact on the surviving disk drive. 
The controller continues to service the data requests from the surviving disk of a mirrored pair. 
When the failed disk is replaced with a new disk, 
the controller copies the data from the surviving disk of the mirrored pair. 
Mirroring involves duplication of data – the amount of storage capacity that is needed is 
twice the amount of data being stored. 
Mirroring is considered expensive and is preferred for mission-critical applications 
that cannot afford the risk of any data loss.
Mirroring improves read performance because read requests can be serviced by both disks. 
However, write performance is slightly lower than a single disk because each write request 
manifests as two writes on the disk drives."
	
=====================================================================================================	
	
(*****)	 ---> What is latency?
	"Latency is also known as delay. 
Latency is the time it takes for data to transfer from source to destination .
The lower the latency, the higher the performance.
Letancy is measured in miliseconds."
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Response time?
	"Response time is the time it takes for data to transfer from source to destination 
and get the acknowledgment from desntination for the successful delivery of data.
When a server sends a write request to storage, storage writes the data to cache 
and sends ""write-complete"" acknowledgement back to the server.
The time taken between server request and response from stroage is known as response time."
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Bandwidth?
	"Bandwidth is the maximum volume of data that can be transferred through a link. 
The more the bandwidth the better the performance.
Bandwidth can be measured in Kbps, Mbps."
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is Throughput?
	"Throughput is the actual volume of data that is transferred through a link.
Throughput can be measured in IOPS or Mbps?"
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is QoS?
	"QoS is Quality of Service.
Quality of Service is a feature that limits I/O between hosts to storage resources.
QoS is used to gurantee the required bandwidth to storage traffic
We can create QoS policy.
In that policy we can specify minimum, maximum and burst limits by setting throughput in IOPS or bandwidth in KBPS or MBPS 
or combination of both types of limits.
If both thresholds are set, the system limits traffic according to the threshold that is reached first.
QoS policy can be shared and not shared"
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	 RAID 0
	"Raid 0 is just striping only.
We need two or more disks.
It does not protect data against disk failure. 
We get full capacity. We do not lose any space here.
It is not recommended for production environement, only for test environement where data loss is accepted.

Review once	"Performance on both RAID 10 and RAID 01 will be the same.
The storage capacity on these will be the same.

The main difference is the fault tolerance level.

RAID 01 fault tolerance is less. 
On RAID 01, since we have only two groups of RAID 0, 
if two drives fails (one in each group), the entire RAID 01 will fail.

RAID 10 fault tolerance is more. 
On RAID 10, since we have only two groups of RAID 1,
since there are many groups (as the individual group is only two disks), 
even if two drives fails (one in each group), the RAID 10 is still functional. 

So, given a choice between RAID 10 and RAID 01, always choose RAID 10."

(*****)	What is encryption? How does it work?
	"Encryption is a data security feature

Encryption is a technique to convert data into secret code.

Encryption ensures data protection from unauthorized access if drives are removed from the system.

Data can be encrypted ""in transit"" or ""at rest"".

Cryptographic key is used to encrypt data."
	
	"There are 2 types of encryption.
Symmetric encryption and Asymmetric encryption.

In symmetric encryption, there is only one key, 
and all communicating parties use the same key for both encryption and decryption. 

In Asymmetric (It is also known as public key encryption), there are two keys: 
One key is used for encryption, and a different key is used for decryption.
Encryption key is known as Public key.
Decryption key is know as private key.

The decryption key is kept private.
Encryption key is shared publicly."
	
	"If the data is encrypted on a hard drive and if that hard disk is lost or stolen
then the data on that hard drive can not be decrypted without key.
So it data is secure.
Similarly, encrypted communications enable the communicating parties to exchange sensitive data 
without leaking the data."
	
====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is De-Duplication and how it works?
	"De-duplication searches for duplicate blocks which contains dulicate data.
When duplicate block is detected, it is not retained, but instead it creates a “data pointer”.
This ""data pointer"" points to the block which contains exact copy of data which is already stored on the disk.

De-duplication feature works well with datasets that have lots of duplicated date (for example, full backups). Deduplication helps in replicating data quickly."

(*****)	What is a spare disk, hotspare or Disk Sparing?
	"Hotspare is a disk which is not configured in any Raidgroup or pool.
It is configured as spare disk, ready to be usded in case of disk failure.
If any disk failed, then the data from failed disk is copied to spare disk.
If the failed disk is not available then data is regenerated from good drives
and stored in spare disk.
Once failed disk is replaced, data from spare disk is copied back to new replaced disk.
In newer storage, new disk becomes the spare disk."

=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is HDD and components of HDD?
	"Traditional mechanical hard disk drive have moving components.
SAS, NL-SAS

===================================================================================
Components of HDD
Spindle, Motor, Magnetic coated platters, Actuator Arm with read/write head, 
Controller board (PCB), Power Connector, Data interface, Head Assembly
===================================================================================

When we format a disk, it logically creates tracks and sectors.
Sector is also referred to as block. 512 bytes, 2KB, 4KB.
Block size is fixed
Outer track have more space and inner track have less space."
	
	"I/O operations in hard drives are performed by rapidly moving the arm across the rotating flat platters 
that are coated with magnetic material. 
Data is transferred between the disk controller and magnetic platters through the read/write (R/W) head 
which is attached to the arm. 
Data can be recorded and erased on magnetic platters any number of times. 

A typical hard disk drive consists of one or more flat circular disks called platters. 
The data is recorded on these platters in binary codes. 
The set of rotating platters is sealed in a case, called Head Disk Assembly (HDA). 
A platter is a rigid, round disk coated with magnetic material on both surfaces (top and bottom)."
	
	"Data can be written to or read from both surfaces of the platter. 
The number of platters and the storage capacity of each platter determine the total capacity of the drive. 

A spindle connects all the platters and is connected to a motor. 
The motor of the spindle rotates with a constant speed. 
The disk platter spins at a speed of several thousands of revolutions per minute (RPM). 

When the spindle rotates, a microscopic air gap is maintained between the R/W heads and the platters, 
which are known as the head flying height. 
This air gap is removed when the spindle stops rotating and the R/W head rests on a special area 
on the platter near the spindle. This area is called the landing zone."
	
	"R/W heads are mounted on the actuator arm assembly, 
which positions the R/W head at the location on the platter where the data must be written or read. 
The R/W heads for all platters on a drive are attached to one actuator arm assembly 
and move across the platters simultaneously. 

The controller is a printed circuit board, mounted at the bottom of a disk drive. 
It consists of a microprocessor, internal memory, circuitry, and firmware. 
The firmware controls the power that is supplied to the spindle motor 
and controls the speed of the motor. 
It also manages the communication between the drive and the compute system. 
In addition, it controls the R/W operations by moving the actuator arm and switching between 
different R/W heads, and performs the optimization of data access."
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is seek time?
	"The seek time is also known as access time.
Seek time is the time that is taken to position the actuator arm and R/W heads over the correct track. 
The lower the seek time, the faster the I/O operation. "
	
=====================================================================================================	
(*****)	What is rotational latency?
	"Rotational latency is the time that is taken by the platter to rotate and position the sector under the R/W head.
Rotational latency depends on the rotation speed of the spindle and is measured in milliseconds."
	
	The data transfer rate (also called transfer rate) denotes the average amount of data per unit time that the drive can deliver to the HBA. In a read operation, the data first moves from disk platters to R/W heads; then it moves to the drive’s internal buffer. Finally, data moves from the buffer through the interface to the HBA on a compute.  
	
	Disk service time = Seek time + Rotational latency + Data transfer rate

What is the iscsi port number? ( ** ) 

The iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) protocol typically uses port 3260 for communication. Port 3260 is the default port number for iSCSI, both for the well-known port and the registered port. However, it's worth noting that iSCSI can be configured to use a different port if needed. If a different port is used, it would need to be specified in the connection configuration.

	"an environment that utilizes persistent binding, once a system has booted, it will maintain a constant view of the same target ID because the driver software remaps the SCSI target ID to the new WWNN on the fly. 
  

  
Persistent Binding Advantages: 
  
A second system may use a different SCSI target ID for that target. Thus, an administrator seeking to work with the same target across multiple hosts must be prepared to encounter the situation where the same fibre channel target is known by different SCSI target IDs. Use persistent binding to maintain a consistent target ID on all systems. A common scenario for this type of situation would be a network administrator who needs to consistently map to a tape drive for backup purposes. "
	"Use the Persistent Binding for Tape Devices.
Persistent binding is a host-centric enforced way of directing an operating system to assign certain SCSI target IDs and LUNs."

## What is Data Deduplication?

**Data deduplication** is a data compression technique used to eliminate duplicate copies of repeating data. It is commonly used in storage systems to improve storage efficiency and reduce the amount of storage space required. The process involves identifying and removing redundant data blocks, ensuring that only one unique instance of the data is stored.

### How Does Data Deduplication Work?

1. **Data Chunking**: The data is divided into smaller chunks or segments. These chunks can be of fixed size or variable size, depending on the deduplication algorithm used.

2. **Hashing**: Each chunk is processed through a cryptographic hash function to generate a unique identifier (hash value). This hash value acts as a fingerprint for the chunk.

3. **Comparison**: The hash value of each chunk is compared against a database of existing hash values. If the hash value already exists in the database, it indicates that the chunk is a duplicate.

4. **Storage**: 
   - **Unique Chunks**: If the chunk is unique (i.e., its hash value is not found in the database), it is stored, and its hash value is added to the database.
   - **Duplicate Chunks**: If the chunk is a duplicate, it is not stored again. Instead, a reference to the existing chunk is created.

5. **Reconstruction**: When data needs to be retrieved, the system uses the references to reconstruct the original data from the stored chunks.

## Benefits of Using Data Deduplication in Storage

1. **Storage Efficiency**: By eliminating duplicate data, deduplication significantly reduces the amount of storage space required. This is particularly beneficial for environments with large volumes of redundant data, such as backup and archival systems.

2. **Cost Savings**: Reduced storage requirements lead to lower costs for storage hardware, maintenance, and data center space. This can result in significant cost savings for organizations.

3. **Improved Backup and Recovery**: Deduplication can enhance the efficiency of backup and recovery processes. Smaller data sets mean faster backup times and quicker recovery in case of data loss.

4. **Network Efficiency**: In distributed storage systems, deduplication can reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. This leads to lower bandwidth usage and faster data transfers.

5. **Environmental Impact**: By reducing the need for additional storage hardware, deduplication contributes to lower energy consumption and a smaller carbon footprint.

6. **Scalability**: Deduplication allows storage systems to scale more efficiently by optimizing the use of available storage resources.
